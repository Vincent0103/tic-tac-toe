# tic-tac-toe

## Goals

- Make a tic-tac-toe like game website, where users can click on cells from the game board to place their mark (either cross or circle)

## features to add

- preview move on hover on the gameBoard (eg: cross or circle on hover) (*ADDED*)

### Apologizes

- Extremely sorry for the complex logic i implemented for the tic-tac-toe game, i seriously couldn't come up with an easier algorithm but i'm pretty sure there is one. I wish you luck though if you ever want to trying to read my code to understand how the computer knows whenever someone has won the game.
- btw the bot isn't really playing using the minimax() algorithm it is actually using math.random(), i couldn't implement it because there were too many conflicts with the current code. BUT, i'll try my best to implement this quickly later on! Happy tic-tac-toe!
