# tic-tac-toe

## features to add

### Apologizes

- Extremely sorry for the complex logic i implemented for the tic-tac-toe game, i seriously couldn't come up with an easier algorithm but i'm pretty sure there is one. I wish you luck though if you ever want to trying to read my code to understand how the computer knows whenever someone has won the game.
